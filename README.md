 ## Intro
The smart outlet PCB designed specifically to fit traditional wall mount light switch boxes with dimensions 54x54x45++mm, brings a new level of convenience and functionality to residential and commercial spaces. This innovative solution seamlessly replaces the conventional light switch, providing users with the ability to control their lighting or other connected devices remotely. The compact PCB design ensures a perfect fit within the existing switch box, eliminating the need for any additional modifications or wiring. With features like wireless connectivity, compatibility with voice assistants, and programmable scheduling, this smart outlet PCB revolutionizes the way we interact with our electrical systems, making our lives more efficient and comfortable.

## OEM Firmware code
The OEM version of the firmware code can be found in the folder **firmware code**.  It has by default OTA updates, meaning this smart switch device automatically updates itself when newer updated versions are made available here.  
This code uses my own ESP32 C++ class libraries to expedite the development of code for ESP32 microcontrollers. The repository is located [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-ESP32-C-Base-Firmware-Libraries#readme) for anyone to use.

### Home App for Androidâ„¢
HomeApp is a small and easy to use smart home app with a simple framework. The goal of this application is to make remote execution of predefined features as easy and user-friendly as possible to help you get started with smart home technology.

### Legend
ðŸŸ¢ **Hardware or firmware fully tested and working** <br>
A green circle means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming code was fully tested, each of its functionalities and capabilities. And it can be installed in a vehicle. Keep in mind this does not mean errors won't happen. As in everything related to electronics and software, there are revisions and updates. This open hardware is no different.

ðŸŸ¡ **Hardware or firmware not tested. Working capability is unknown, it may work or not.** <br>
A yellow circle means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming code was not fully tested, each of its functionalities and capabilities. This does not mean it not working , it simply means testing is needed before giving a green circle of approval.  

ðŸ”´ **Hardware or firmware fully tested but not working.** <br>
A red circle means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming code was fully tested, and found some kind of critical error or fault. This means the electronics or firmware code cannot be used in a vehicle. 

âŒ› **Hardware Design / firmware programming not started.** <br>
The hour glass means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming hasn't started. Most likely because is waiting for the necessary test components needed for reverse engineering and also engineering of the new open solution. 

ðŸ†• **New updated contents** <br>
The new icon means the link next to it was recently updated with new contents 

ðŸ’¬  **Comments on the Discussion page** <br>
The comments icon means there are usefeul and even new comments on the [discussions page](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-AI-Volvo-MKII-Open-Hardware/discussions) important for what you are seeing or reading.
